    <h1>SnapWOD Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-11-13</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SnapWOD helps you scan and manage workouts. We respect your privacy and
      collect only what is needed to operate the app and provide premium features.
      This policy describes what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information:</strong> When you sign in (for example with email or Google), we receive your Firebase User ID (UID) and email address.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchases &amp; subscriptions:</strong> We receive subscription status and related metadata from RevenueCat. We do not store full payment details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Usage metrics:</strong> We count OCR and AI extraction requests and basic service usage to enforce free-tier limits and improve reliability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Content you submit:</strong> Images you send for OCR are transmitted to our server and processed by Google Cloud Vision to return text. If you opt to use AI plan extraction, the extracted workout text (not the image) may be sent to our AI provider to structure it into a timer plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device &amp; logs:</strong> Basic diagnostic logs (e.g., timestamps, request identifiers, status codes, error traces). In some cases we may log short, truncated previews of submitted text to help debug failures; we minimize this and avoid logging image content.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate users and maintain accounts.</li>
      <li>Provide premium features and verify entitlements.</li>
      <li>Process images via Google Cloud Vision to extract text.</li>
      <li>Operate, secure, and improve the app and backend services.</li>
      <li>Enforce fair-use limits for free tiers.</li>
      <li>Optionally structure extracted workout text into a timer plan via our AI provider when enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing with Service Providers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication and Firestore data storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Google Cloud Vision:</strong> OCR of images you submit.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Subscription management and entitlement status.</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> When AI plan extraction is enabled, we send extracted workout text (no images) to OpenAI to convert it into a structured timer plan.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account and subscription records:</strong> Retained while your account exists.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage counters:</strong> Retained for monthly quota tracking and audits.</li>
      <li><strong>Images:</strong> Transmitted for processing and not stored long-term beyond what is necessary to fulfill the request and operate logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Logs:</strong> Retained for a limited period to operate, secure, and troubleshoot the service, then deleted or aggregated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data is transmitted over HTTPS/TLS. Provider systems (Firebase/Google Cloud,
      RevenueCat, and OpenAI) use encryption at rest. We use access controls and
      least-privilege credentials for backend services. We do not implement
      end-to-end encryption for user-submitted images or text; data is protected in
      transit and at rest by our infrastructure and service providers.
    </p>

    <h2>Account &amp; Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You can request deletion of your account and associated data at any time.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>How to request deletion:</strong> You can delete your account directly from within the app
        by using the &ldquo;Delete Account&rdquo; option on the Account tab. You can also email us at
        <a href="mailto:snapwodmanagement@gmail.com">snapwodmanagement@gmail.com</a>
        from the same email address you use in the app, with a clear subject such as
        &ldquo;Delete my SnapWOD account&rdquo; and, if possible, your approximate last sign-in date.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What we delete:</strong> We will delete or anonymize your Firebase authentication record,
        stored email address, subscription and entitlement records, and per-user usage counters that are
        linked to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Local app data:</strong> Saved workouts and preferences stored locally on your device are
        removed when you uninstall the app. We do not store your workout library on our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What we may retain:</strong> We may keep limited information that we are required to retain
        for legal, accounting, fraud prevention, or security purposes (for example, aggregated usage metrics
        or payment processor records). Where retained, this data is minimized and kept only for as long as necessary,
        then deleted or anonymized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Delete some data but keep your account:</strong> If you want us to delete certain data
        (for example, usage logs associated with your account) while keeping your account active,
        contact us at the same email address and tell us what you would like removed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may sign out at any time.</li>
      <li>You can request account or data deletion as described above.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to use AI plan extraction; OCR-only functionality will remain available subject to your plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Data may be processed on servers located in the United States and other regions where our providers operate.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page with an updated effective date.

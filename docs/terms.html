      <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
      <p>SnapWOD lets you read text from photos and convert it into workout timers. We use third-party services (e.g., Google Cloud Vision and an AI model) to power these features.</p>

      <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must provide accurate information and keep your account secure.</li>
        <li>Email verification may be required to access AI features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Subscriptions &amp; Billing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>SnapWOD Premium is an auto-renewing subscription billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play.</li>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your app-store account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>The subscription renews automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</strong></li>
        <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time in your App Store or Google Play subscription settings.</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled by the app store in accordance with their policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Usage Limits (Fair Use)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All accounts, including Premium, are subject to a <strong>hard monthly cap</strong> of up to 100 AI “reads” per month, unless otherwise stated in the app.</li>
        <li>Free-tier usage is limited and may require upgrading to Premium when the free quota is exceeded.</li>
        <li>We may rate-limit requests to protect reliability and costs.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>No content that is unlawful, harmful, or infringes others’ rights.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
